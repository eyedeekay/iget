# iget
i2p terminal http client.

## description:
This is a highly-configurable curl/wget like client which exclusively works
over i2p. It works via the SAM API which means it has some advantages and
some disadvantages, as follows:

### Advantages:
These advantages motivated development. More may emerge as it continues.

  - uses the SAM API to prevent destination-reuse for different sites
  - uses the SAM API directly(not forwarding) so it can't leak information
    to clearnet services
  - inline options to configure i2cp, so for example we can have 8 tunnels
    in and 2 tunnels out

### Disadvantages:
Only two I know of so far.

  - marginally slower, due to tunnel-creation at runtime.
  - a few missing options compared to eepget(These are being handled by
    including a wrapper, which will be fully compatible with eepget)

Wherever possible, short arguments will mirror their curl equivalents.
However, I'm not trying to implement every single curl option, and if
there are arguments that are labeled differently between curl and eepget,
eepget options will be used instead. I haven't decided if I want it to be
able to spider eepsites on it's own, but I'm leaning toward no. That's what
lynx and grep are for.

## to build:

        make deps build

## to use:
